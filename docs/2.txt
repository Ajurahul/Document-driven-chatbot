How to calculate income tax? (See example)
Income tax calculation for the Salaried

Income from salary is the sum of Basic salary + HRA + Special Allowance + Transport Allowance + any other allowance. Some components of your salary are exempt from tax, such as telephone bills reimbursement, leave travel allowance. If you receive HRA and live on rent, you can claim exemption on HRA. Calculate exempt portion of HRA, by using this HRA Calculator.

On top of these exemptions, a standard deduction of 50,000 is available in both old and new regimes. This has been increased to Rs. 75,000 in Latest Budget 2024 only for New Regime

In case you opt for the new tax regime, these exemptions will not be available to you.

Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ’s )
How much tax should I pay on my salary in New Regime?

You will be required to pay a tax depending on the income slab you belong to.

Above Rs 10 lakh and up to Rs 12 lakh	15%
Above Rs 12 lakh and up to Rs 15 lakh	20%
Above Rs 15 lakh	30%
Suppose you have a taxable income of Rs 9 lakh, your tax will be calculated as follows:

Income Slab	Applicable Tax Rate	Applicable Income	Tax (in Rs)
Up to Rs 3 lakh	No tax	0	0
Above Rs 3 lakh and up to Rs 7 lakh	5%	Rs 4 lakhs	20,000

Total Income Tax Payable			40,000
Hence, you will be required to pay a tax of Rs 20,000 (excluding cess) on your taxable income i.e. Rs 9 lakhs.

What is the maximum non-taxable income limit?

In the case of the old regime, The maximum limit of non-taxable income for an individual was set at Rs 2.5 lakh. However, you can also get a rebate of Rs 2,500 under section 87A if you have a total income of up to Rs 3.5 lacs for FY 2018-19. From FY 2019-20 onwards, the rebate has been increased to Rs 12,500 for an income up to Rs 5 lakh. So, that means an individual earning up to 5 lakh will not be required to pay any income tax from FY 2019-20 onwards. If you have tax saving investments under section 80C of up to Rs 1.5 lakh then you will not have to pay any taxes till Rs 6.5 lakhs

In the budget 2023, In case of New Regime, The maximum limit of non-taxable income for an individual is set at Rs 3 lakh. However, you can also get a rebate of Rs 25000 under section 87A if you have a total income of up to Rs 7 lacs for FY 2023-24. So, that means an individual earning up to 7 lakh will not be required to pay any income tax from FY 2023-24 onwards. However, in the case of the old regime, the limit for rebate under section 87A is still 5 lakhs.
